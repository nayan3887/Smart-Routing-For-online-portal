ChartDirector Javadoc for IDE Usage
===================================

The JavaDoc contained in this directory is not for human reading. It only 
contains method prototypes but not description of the methods. It is intended 
for some integrated development environments (IDE) that can import Javadoc and 
use it to pop up "intellisense" tool tips during code editing.

For human reading, please use the CHM documentation, which can be download from 
http://www.advsofteng.com/download.html, or the HTML documentation, which is 
included in the doc subdirectory of the ChartDirector for JSP/Java distribution.
